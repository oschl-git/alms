The **Aperture Laboratories Messaging Service (ALMS)** is a backend REST API server for handling internal communication in Aperture Science, a fictional research facility from Valve's shared Portal and Half-Life universe.

For an example of a client, check out [**Aperture Messenger**](https://github.com/oschl-git/aperture-messenger). Aperture Messenger is a CLI client, but you're welcome to write your own, as ALMS endpoints are well documented and everything is open-source. If you're interested in doing so, check out [the documentation]().
